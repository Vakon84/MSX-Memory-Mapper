#Installing the 2MB mapper (ver.B) in the Panasonic FS-A1

1. The chips marked with numbers (1) CPU and (2) DRAM memory should be desoldered.
2. If possible, gently put the capacitor (3). If not, solder a new one lying down.
3. In place of the CPU (1), solder the precision socket.
4. In place of the DRAM memory (2), you can solder the sockets, if you want to return to the previous configuration.
5. Put the mapper module into the CPU socket (1).
6. The point marked on the mapper PCB as SLTSL is connected with a cable to the place where pin 16 of one of the DRAM chips was.

All modifications are reversible. It is enough to unsolder the cable, remove the module and insert the CPU and DRAM into the sockets.
